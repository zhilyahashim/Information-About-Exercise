                <p>There are several types of exercise, and they provide a range of benefits for health and well-being.<br>
                    Aerobic exercise aims to improve how the body uses oxygen.<br> Most aerobic exercise takes place at average levels of intensity over longer periods.
                    
                    <br>An aerobic exercise session involves warming up, exercising for at least 20 minutes, <br>and then cooling down. Aerobic exercise mostly uses large muscle groups.</p>
                    <h4 style="color:rgb(226, 55, 43)">Aerobic exercise provides the following benefits:</h4>
                    <li>improves muscle strength in the lungs, heart, and whole body.</li>
                    <li>lowers blood pressure.</li>
                    <li>improves circulation and blood flow in the muscles.</li>
                    <li>increases the red blood cell count to enhance oxygen transportation.</li>
                    <li>reduces the riskTrusted Source of diabetes, stroke, and cardiovascular disease (CVD).</li>
                    <li>improves life expectancyTrusted Source and symptoms for people with coronary artery diseases.</li>
                    <li>stimulates bone growth and reduces the risk of osteoporosis when at high intensity.</li>
                    <li>improves sleep hygiene.</li>
                    <li>improves sleep hygiene.</li>
                    <li>enhances stamina by increasing the body’s ability to store energy molecules, such as fats and carbohydrates, within muscle.</li>

                         <h2 title="TYPES AND BENEFITS">Anaerobic exercise</h2>
                         <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTXgnYhBy2wMcdIIVw12r8pu6RXze3Kt3_PVw&usqp=CAU">
                         <br><p>Anaerobic exercise does not use oxygen for energy. People use this type of exercise to build power, strength, and muscle mass.

                         </p>
                        <h3 style="color:hsl(4, 76%, 53%)">These exercises are high-intensity activities that should last no longer than around 2 minutes.<br> Anaerobic exercises include:</h3>
                         <li>weightlifting.</li>
                         <li>sprinting.</li>
                         <li>intensive and fast skipping with a rope.</li>
                         <li>interval training.</li>
                         <li>isometrics.</li>
                         <li>any rapid burst of intense activity.</li>
                         <p>While all exercise benefits the heart and lungs, anaerobic exercise provides fewer benefits for cardiovascular health than aerobic exercise and uses fewer calories. However, <br>
                            it is more effective than aerobic exercise for building muscle and improving strength.</p>

                           <h2 style="color:rgb(0, 195, 255)">note :-</h2>
                           <p>Increasing muscle mass causes the body to burn more fat, even when resting. Muscle is the most efficient tissue for burning fat in the body.</p>

                           <h2 title="TYPES AND BENEFITS">Agility training</h2>
                           <img width="400px" height="300px" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRMtYKSH1PWMZ0BXhrS3fgWFS4La1_9dujEIA&usqp=CAU"
                           
                           <br><p>Agility training aims to improve a person’s ability to maintain control while speeding up, slowing down, and changing direction.<br>

                            In tennis, for example, agility training helps a player maintain control over their court positioning through good recovery after each shot.<br>
                            
                            People who take part in sports that heavily rely on positioning, coordination, speed, and balance need to engage in agility training regularly.</p>

                            <h3 style="color:hsl(4, 76%, 53%) ">The following sports are examples of ones that require agility:</h3>
                            <li>tennis</li>
                            <li>American football</li>
                            <li>hockey</li>
                           <li> badminton</li>
                           <li> volleyball</li>

                         <h2 style="color:rgb(167, 98, 8)">Stretching and flexibility</h2>
                         <p>Yoga can help improve a person’s flexibility and relieve stress.
                            Some exercises combine stretching, muscle conditioning, and balance training. A popular and effective example is yoga.<br>
                            
                            Yoga movements improve balance, flexibility, posture, and circulation.<br>
                            
                            The practice originated in India thousands of years ago and aims to unify the mind, body, and spirit. Modern yoga uses a combination of meditation,<br> posture, and breathing exercises to achieve the same goals.
                            
                            A yoga practitioner can tailor a course for individual needs.<br>
                            
                            A person looking to manage arthritis might need gentle stretches to improve mobility and function. <br> with depression, on the other hand, may need more emphasis on the relaxation and deep breathing elements of yoga.<br>
                            
                            Pilates is another stretching option that promotes flexibility and core strength.<br> Tai chi is also an effective option for exercise that promotes calm stretching rather than intensity.</p>
